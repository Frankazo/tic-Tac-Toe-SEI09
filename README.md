 INTRODUCTION
 ------------

  This is the First project for Software engineering Immersive SEI09.
  Tic-tac-toe is a game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

  The project is base on building a Webapp that runs the game, create the game from scratch, follow all the requirement and deploy a working version on Github.

  PLANING AND DEVELOPMENT
  -----------------------

  ### Game Logic

  - Simple 3*3 game board
  - Click handler for a click on the game board
  - Clicks on a valid space add their X or O
  - Board representation in JS
  - Keep track of the current player
  - Current player rotates between X and O
  - Logic to check Board for Winner
  - Create and Arrays with the 8 possible wining combinations
  - After each play check Board representation vs wining combinations for 'X' or 'O'
          (store.combinations.some(combo => combo.every(v => store.board[v] === 'X') || combo.every(v => store.board[v] === 'O')))
  - If this is false in the last play then is a Draw

  ### Game UI

  - Update the game engine when the game board is updated
  - Message user when the turn changes
  - Message user when clicks on an invalid space
  - Message user when the game is over (win or draw)
  - Not allow to add an X or O to any spaces after the game is over
